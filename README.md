# chooseownadventure
This (VERY) short choose your own adventure game features a silly story in which you challenge justin bieber to a dance off, yet in the vernacular of olde english.  
It was built using jquery and the materialize front-end framework.
As you load up the page, you will be prompted to choose one of a few responses to questions. 
As you answer each question, a new question will be posed, leading you down different paths based on your choices.
Eventually, you will reach the end of the game, and will be asked if you'd like to play again.

This game was made to better understand jquery and how it works in a modern web environment.
